# Your-First-100-days

Congratulations! You’ve landed a job as a product manager. Now, you have a few days to prepare to show up, make a good first impression, integrate with a bunch of strangers, and somehow, establish yourself as a leader. In my experience, most of the time, the people you’re about to work with haven’t worked with good product managers and aren’t certain what a product manager is supposed to do.

I am sure there are many ways to approach this situation. I’ve tried several, some have worked well, many have worked poorly. I’m convinced there’s one approach that works really well. If you give this a try, let me know how it goes.

tl;dr:

**Before you start**
1. Before you start, learn the world’s impressions of your product. Buy a book, take the company's training, read the product documentation.

**First two weeks**
1. Be humble. Tell everyone you plan to focus on the backlog and the roadmap to get started.
2. Introduce yourself to everyone, every business function. Start to build your own views on how the organization works.
3. Try to identify your primary team, demand to see their backlog and to join their planning meetings.
4. Ask to be included in every existing and potential customer / user meeting. Introduce yourself and your intent to listen only. Make no commitments.

**First three months**
1. Try to use your product. Start an outrage log.
1. Articulate your own understanding of the **existing** roadmap, in writing. Review with your product team peers (engineering lead, design lead, your boss, etc.) and ask for feedback.
1. Identify your potential allies, both within  your company as well as users, analysts, OSS users or even bloggers.
1. Start to arrange your own, informal roadmap review meetings.
1. Start to create value by restating existing bugs in terms of customer impact, create new bugs by reading the support channels.

**First six months**
1. Start producing artifacts of value. There’s a whole separate blog post on this, but whatever makes sense, start doing it. Start small, write stories, continue answering support tickets, create new roadmap presentations. Whatever it is, they have to be in writing. See the blog post for more on this.
2. **Also,** start to iterate on your product strategy. Conduct informal exercises with team members, and if comfortable, members from different functions (marketing, sales, etc). Use that information to build a list of priorities. Don’t worry about cost to implement.
3. Schedule a formal review. Preferably have this as a written document (my opinion) rather than a slide deck. Slides are best at providing a summarization of a more detailed plan. Now that you’ve been around long enough, you want people to understand the entire detailed plan. Get as much feedback as you can.
4. After reviewing with lower-level peers, schedule summary reviews with leaders. It’s very important to get their understanding and feedback. You may need to present a summary here, and that’s OK. You must establish a rhythm of presenting and incorporating feedback regularly. Make sure to report back after making changes based on feedback. Do this rapidly; within the same week if possible. It can be as simple as an e-mail, “Hey Paul, I heard you when you noted that I was wrong about the placement of the time setting controls. I’ve updated the document to reflect your suggestions.” Time is critical; by getting back to them super promptly, you’re telling them that you value your feedback, and in turn, they’ll give you more time and attention in the future.

## Before you start
Learn the external view of the product. Buy a book if possible. Actually read it. Otherwise voraciously read blogs, especially the comment section.

## First two weeks
Be humble. Even if you’re a subject matter expert, share that knowledge very sparingly.

Make becoming part of your team your first priority. In every case where I've procrastinated meeting my assigned product development team, I've regretted it. If your team knows you're identified for them, but you appear too busy to become embedded, they'll dismiss you early.

Try to use your product. I have a saying, "any product manager who suggests a course of action to a customer that they haven't tried themselves is probably lying." 

> Taking over a new product is a unique time to document your first time user experience (FTUE). I ask every new product manager on the team to keep an, "outrage log," ie, the barriers that you experience when trying to use the product. Keeping a log file, a notebook, whatever, is very valuable during these early weeks. These are your users' first impressions, and if they're serious enough, they'll abandon your product. Within just a few weeks, you will be blind to this friction, so keeping a log that you can refer to later will be useful in prioritizing "ease of use," over "feature of the week."

Typically, there’ll be a stack of work waiting for you; that’s why leadership decided to hire a product manager. People will want to meet you because they have been waiting for someone to make decisions. Others will have been waiting on things that a product manager would deliver, like a roadmap. Try not to be overwhelmed. Stay focused on this plan. Try to resist making commitments or snap judgements.  You can’t dodge everything, but minimize waste. It’s fine to explain your plan (this plan, or some version of it), as justification of why you can’t do everything right away!

To minimize early decisions, you might rely on your existing product team leads. If it's truly urgent, consult with the existing leaders. Unless you truly know that this is a huge mistake, adopt their suggestions as the team's decision. This may feel scary, you might be worried that you’re displaying weakness or incompetence - but I think it’s the reverse. It establishes trust quickly and also shows that you’re a leader who is willing to make decisions with incomplete data.

If you choose to make the preponderance of decisions using your own experience as a guide, you will risk failing to build that trust, especially if your lack of context leads you to make poor decisions that have be wound back later. Better to establish yourself as a team member who makes decisions together. That way, if your choices turn out to be off-track, some inevitably will, you can come back to your team, “We made this decision together. Now that I’ve been here for a while, I think it wasn’t quite right. Given this evidence, I think we should adjust in this way. What do you think about changing course?” #Teamwork

Conversely, if you refuse to make any decisions, allowing the team to blunder on as they have been, you’re delaying making an impact. People will be super anxious to see you establish yourself. Delaying that will cause them to doubt you, and those first impressions can linger a long time. By establishing yourself as a team player first, you’ll buy yourself time to learn context and make course-corrections down the line.


## First three months
Articulate your own understanding of the [roadmap][3-roadmaps]. It’s very important to do this in writing, either a text document or a slide deck (see link). Review this with your product team peers, what did you get wrong, what are you under-emphasizing?

Start to get to know the go to market organization. It can take many different forms, and may not even be exclusively a Sales team. Look for other teams in Marketing or customer engineering teams whose responsibility is to solve problems on-the-fly at active user enagagements. Learn how your product is percieved by those functions - do they appreciate the product, or are they forced to work with it, "because leadership tells us to." Your life will be much easier if you make it a goal for the thing to practically sell itself - instead of an adversarial relationship, the field will proactively seek you out, identifying friction to adoption.

Expand your audience beyond your rehearsals with your peers above, begin to meet people in related functions (sales, marketing), and begin to schedule meetings with outside users. _It’s critical that you establish this as a major part of your job responsibilities early._ When you meet with customers, introduce yourself as a new Product Manager, that you’re conducting informal conversations to understand product/customer roadmap *alignment*. Make to commitments. Listen. Ask lots of questions. Your goal is to understand if the roadmap of the product matches existing or potential users’ expectations. Try as hard as you can to talk with a variety of voices - end users, decision makers, even a few leaders, if possible.

I frequently hear that it's hard to schedule meetings with customers. I agree! This is a major reason why product management is a full time job - getting in front of customers takes a ton of effort. People are naturally protective of their customer relationships. It gives them a feeling that they're exclusively valuable to the organization, and they don't want a bozo wrecking their relationship with their customer. I often have to force my way into those meetings. This is one of the few situations where I choose to be determined and inflexible. I tell field team members, "I need to be involved in your customer meetings so that I can help prioritize the work appropriately. I know you can act as a gateway for them, but I need to hear from customers directly, **so that** I can extract themes, which will make us more stable and predictable in the eyes of your customer, and also make the product scale to more users. I promise not to be disrutive. I mostly want to listen, but it's a big part of my job to meet with customers, so if you can't pull me in, I can't do my job, and I can't contribute. I'd have to share this with my manager."

My bet is that you’ll learn a lot. Chances are, the product isn’t fully aligned with users’ expectations. If everything was going well, your company probably wouldn’t have needed to hire you.

**Start to contribute:**
1. Use this one trick to start to contribute in a meaningful way immediately! Look at the bugs in the backlog. Bugs are very rarely expressed in terms of business impact. Interview the engineers, and transform the bug titles from "refactor function xyz to avoid ijk exception," to say, "Fix crash when user engages flux capacitor above 15 mph so that users can engage time travel while escaping bad guys."
2. Trawl the support backlog. Incomprehensibly, many product teams ignore their own support channels. This is a huge error, especially for a new product manager. The support channels are a secret shortcut to grokking the product. Start to review the support channels, whatever their forms might be. This could be an OSS github issues page, it could be your support team, it could even be StackOverflow. Wherever customers are asking questions, start to understand their challenges and, if possible, start to answer them. Product Managers are not expert support engineers, but we should be able to answer basic questions about the product. Doing this activity will have two immediate effects. First, it will start to build credibility. Many people will be worried that you’re either an idiot or a dilettante, here to talk strategy but provide no real value. By answering support tickets, you demonstrate that you’re humble, willing to work hard, and are starting to master the product at a technical level. Second, you’ll start to form material opinions about where the customer base is today. Many product teams are driven more by sales opportunities than existing customers. This is natural, you want the business to grow, but it causes a form of far-sightedness where the product team is always running forward, never looking behind. With concrete data (it can start out anecdotal, that’s OK) about experiences customers are having today, you’ll have your first chances to exert your influence as a product manager. “Yes, we absolutely should be looking at integrating Mr. Fusion, but a lot of people aren’t getting value out of the time machine today because the Flux Capacitor only works approximately 70% of the time, and customers are losing trust.”

The sooner you can get to expressing yourself in this way, the sooner you’ll gain credibility and start to make a positive change to the product.

If you primarily focus on these two activities, within three months, you might be ready to take over responsibility for the roadmap. There’s a key distinction here - taking over the roadmap doesn’t mean that now the product manager is making all the decisions. It means you’re now the primary who suggests changes to the roadmap.

Engineering teams that author their own roadmap focus mainly on two things: Primarily, they’re busy addressing the latest demands of leadership, which often change on a whim, based on recency bias. A distant second, engineering teams will prioritize what they think is either cool or obviously something needed by the customers. Mostly, Engineers want to innovate and create value.

As a Product Manager, sort of surprisingly, a big part of our job is to slow that down. That’s because, in a thrashy, high-velocity environment where priorities are often set by the next big deal, we can easily lose sight of the core value the product delivers. By constantly catering to the next thing, we may sacrifice the long-term picture, or even inconvenience the existing user base.

## First six months

Your first three months have been exhausting. You’ve introduced yourself to so many people you want to become a hermit. You feel like you haven’t done hardly anything useful, and you’re anxious to start doing work so that you can feel good about your paycheck. Maybe take a day off, because the next three months are likely the most critical three months in your new role. It’s time to start producing artifacts which express yourself as a leader, and give people a taste of what your contributions will be like - it’s their first chance to evaluate for themselves what kinds of impacts you’ll make as a product manager.

In months three to six, then, you can start to change the nature in which you contribute. It should be possible for you to commit to writing your first Product Requirements Document (PRD). Beyond agile product management, the practice of contributing to the backlog and managing the releases of your product, product requirements are one of the single most valuable assets a product manager can produce. Your goal in writing a PRD is to consolidate your learnings into a specific area of investment. By using your insights to focus on and prioritize a larger outcome, you begin to contribute at a new level. Hopefully you’ll be writing PRDs every quarter for the rest of your PM career.

In parallel to this specific area of work, it’s time to start writing your product strategy. This is important for you to show mastery of your area, and your first major step in leadership. In all honesty, it’s rare to have the opportunity to write a strategy document, and you should leverage your role as newest member of the team to make room for it in your schedule. By articulating not just your vision, but also laying out you steps of how the team can get there, in the most realistic terms possible, you are giving the team a North Star, something that both the product developers can be inspired by, but also that other functions and potential users can understand, either for the purpose of giving you feedback, or better yet, understanding your product goals and direction. By clearly communicating a product strategy, you will make everyone’s lives easier. Things desired by various people either Do align with your strategy, or Do Not. If they do, great! People get a quick decision and know where their requests stand according to the strategy you’ve laid out. If they Do Not, then people benefit from a quick answer, too. Nobody wants to be in the position of, “I’ve been asking Jenny’s team for this for six months and they’ve finally just let me know they’re not the right team. I’ve wasted six months.” And finally, if your strategy doesn’t match your stakeholders’ expectations, you are opening up for constructive feedback. This is your best place not just to accept leadership’s goals when they hired you, but to validate their decisions, and establish why this product effort should exist, and to set expectations on how it will come together.

There’ll be a separate blog post which covers product strategy in detail. It’s mentioned here because you should plan to dedicate a significant amount of your time between your third and sixth month working on this document. If you do not prioritize this work, I guarantee the time won’t materialize easily later.
