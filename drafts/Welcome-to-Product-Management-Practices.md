Hello, happy that you've stumbled onto this blog. Read this article first to understand the goals of these posts.

In my career, I've come across many people with the title, "product manager," that don't have a clear idea of what the basic job responsibilities are, nor do they know which activities will make them the most successful.

During my first five years as a Product Manager at Pivotal Software, I worked in on databases. I began to believe that I was typecast, that I was building a subject matter expertise as my personal ‘moat,’ which would guide my career until retirement. That didn't happen. I found myself as a product manager in an area where databases are not relevant. I was pleased to learn that many of the skills I’d learned translate from one domain to another pretty easily. If I hadn’t lost everything I may never have realized this.

This blog covers the fundamental, universal skills I’ve learned while a part of various teams across 10 years of product management. My goal is to generalize what I’ve learned so that it can benefit others. While most of my experience revolves around enterprise software, it doesn’t mean that these practices can’t be applied elsewhere. I’ve used similar techniques in e-commerce, consumer products, open source and even while producing silicon chips.

What I learned from Pivotal was foundational. After Pivotal, I’ve partnered with many fabulous partners from various backgrounds: engineering, sales, design, program management, etc.. The best these continually challenged our team to do better. Through working with them, we've identified activities which are tremendously useful. This blog those experiences as inspiration, and evolves from those starting points.

The name of this blog is, “Product Management Practices,” not, “New Ideas in Product Management,” or, “The Cutting Edge of Product Management,” etc., because I wanted to document the core activities and work product of a product manager that (to me) seem to be applicable across many industries and many types of products. This is just my take, my own framing of the problem. There are lots of great ways to come up to speed on product management quickly.

If you have:
- Seven minutes: Quick! Go read [Principles to Effective Story Writing: The Pivotal Labs Way][1]. Ryan Jones is the person who taught me how to write stories properly, and it changed my life. You have my permission to ignore the INVEST model if you want.
- Several hours: Read the first 13 chapters of [Planning Extreme Programming][2]. Although that's 70 pages, it's a quick read. This describes, in detail, the daily and weekly activities of a frontline product manager.
- Two or three days: Run, don't walk to a [Pragmatic Institute][3] seminar or a [Productside][4] course. Both of these teach a comprehensive framework so that you can make thoughtful decisions about how to best invest your time.

Other resources:
- There is an amazing amount of material produced by Pivotal and its alumni at [Labs Practices][5] and the [Alumni Codex][6], respectively.
- I learned about [writing practices][7], and became a True Believer in Product Requirements Documents during my time at Hashicorp.
- [Farther, faster, and Far Less Drama][8] is a leadership guide that focuses on making decisions as a team. If you want to be a better leader, and a better team player, I can't think of a better book.

**Conventions**

In my goal to keep the practices within not specific to software, I try to use these terms:

- I try to avoid using the word ‘customer,’ instead I favor, ‘user’ since OSS users, for example, don’t precisely qualify as customers.
- I try to say ‘product developers’ instead of ‘engineers,’ because product development encompasses a lot of roles, not just people who write software.

Please let me know what you think. If I state something too broadly, let me know if I’ve gotten too expansive. Similarly, if you feel left out, because I’m focusing too much on enterprise software, let me know, too. This blog will be better if it contains a variety of points of view, and a variety of voices.

I wanted to produce these blog articles both as a shortcut for me, as I meet new people and describe the same topics repeatedly, and also as conversation starter. In the spirit of, “strong opinions, loosely held,” I hope that by presenting my current state of mind, new ideas will emerge, and that I can continue to learn and expand.

I would love if this blog had multiple voices, not just my own! If you’d like to get involved, I’d welcome your thoughts. Please see the drafts and [contributing instructions][9] on this site’s [GitHub repo][10].
