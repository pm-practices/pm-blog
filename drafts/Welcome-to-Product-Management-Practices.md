Welcome to Product Management Practices
Hello, and very grateful that you’ve discovered this blog. Read this article first to understand the goals of these posts.

The scope of these posts are to cover the experiences and values I’ve learned over 10 years in product management. My goal is to generalize what I’ve learned as much as possible. While most of my experience involves software, it doesn’t mean that these values can’t be applied elsewhere. I’ve used similar techniques in e-Commerce, consumer products, open source software and even when producing silicon chips.

When I decided to become a Product Manager, I was lucky to join Pivotal Software. During my first five years as a PM, I worked in one product and technology area: databases. I began to believe that I was typecast, that I was building a subject matter expertise that was my own personal ‘moat,’ which would guide my career until retirement. Unfortunately, that did not come to pass, and I found myself working Product Management in an area where databases not relevant. I was pleased to learn that many of the skills and practices that I’d learned at Pivotal translated from one industry to another pretty easily. If I hadn’t lost everything, and started over from scratch, I may never have realized this.

If the techniques I learned at Pivotal were sufficient, I would never have need to write this blog. There is an amazing amount of material produced by Pivotal and its alumni, and I will link (example, [Labs Practices][1]) as often as possible. Beyond Labs, I’ve had opportunities to product manage in several non-Pivot environments. I’ve learned valuable lessons there, too.

The name of this blog is, “Product Management Practices,” not, “New Ideas in Product Management,” or, “The Cutting Edge of Product Management,” etc. because I wanted to document the core activities and work product of a product manager that (to me) seem to be applicable across many industries and many types of products.

I hope that I am right, that while most of my PM career has involved selling software (usually enterprise software) to a particular kind of buyer, the techniques are more universal. For example, I try to avoid using the word ‘customer,’ instead I favor, ‘user’ since OSS users, for example, don’t precisely qualify as customers. I try to say ‘product developers’ instead of ‘engineers,’ because product development encompasses a lot of roles, not just people who write software. Please let me know what you think; if I state something too broadly, let me know if I’ve gotten too expansive. Similarly, if you feel left out, because I’m focusing too much on the Enterprise Software Lifecycle, let me know, too. This blog will be better if it contains a variety of points of view, and a variety of voices.  

I wanted to produce an corpus of these practices to blend my Pivotal experience with what I’ve learned since, both as a shortcut for me, as I meet new people and describe the same topics repeatedly, but also as a vehicle for conversation. At Pivotal we tired to adhere to the concept of, “strong opinions, loosely held,” and I hope that by presenting my current point of view, new ideas will emerge, and I can continue to learn and expand.

If you’d like to get involved, I’d welcome your thoughts. Please see the drafts and [contributing instructions][2] on this site’s [GitHub repo][3]. Thanks for reading, hope this helps!
