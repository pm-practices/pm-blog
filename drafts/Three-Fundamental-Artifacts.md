In the [Three Types of Validation][1] post, we remind ourselves to focus on those activities for which we are uniquely qualified, maximizing our contribution. In [PM Recognition and Evaluation][2] I make the case that the fundamental metric used to evaluate product managers should be 'impact.' Since impact is best demonstrated with durable artifacts, this post will cover the most basic things which serve as concrete evidence about work done and value added.

Here are three solid documents PM teams have used to improve communication and demonstrate impact, plus some thoughts on creating stories and epics. This cycle is quarterly, which seems to be a nice balance between giving enough time for the product teams to produce something meaningful, while also getting product to customers fast enough (but not too fast) that they can provide feedback in a way which can impact the roadmap. You may have different cycle times which make better sense for your industry, and that's OK, too.

Let's dive in:

![Quarterly Cycle][4]
In my experience, product managers who follow this process can build credibility. Other business functions will be grateful and align to the predictability of these activities. I’m sure there are other routes to success, but this process has proven solid.

The quarterly cycle starts with the essential basics of product direction and quickly dives down to actionable work. It’s very rare for a product manager to drop into a greenfield project without any existing investment. (Read more on this below) While the activities described in [Your First 100 Days][5] are necessary for the PM to establish her credibility, those are built on these core documents.

## One Pager Project Proposal

Audiences: Product team leads, senior management

The [Project Proposal Summary][3] is an agile way to kick off the process. A one-pager is a proposal to start a project (not a new product!). At the ideation level it covers what a new scope of effort might be, based on previously collected evidence. A lot of organizations skip this step, but I feel that it’s a missed opportunity to gather feedback and possibly fail fast. The content of a one-pager describes the core idea (the what), the justification (what opportunity, why us?), and especially why this is a top priority (why now?). This document can be formal or informal. At first, I used this document to review with my product development lead and director. If they were aware of reasons that my plan isn’t wise, “we can design flux-capacitors, but they’re impossible to fabricate,” or, “your idea for a flux-capacitor is already to focus of another part of the organization,” etc, then I’ve lost nothing but a few lines of analysis in a document, and possibly I’ve learned something. This is much better than coming out with a fully-fleshed out PRD, only to discover it’s not practical, or already solved in some other way.

At other organizations, one-pagers were a built-in part of the formal planning process. Senior management always wants to be included in the planning process, but they don’t want to dive into details. We'd assemble the entire set of project proposals into priority order, and conduct a series of meetings each quarter which showed what the teams were proposing to work on and the remaining scope which wasn't being prioritized right now. This gave senior management confidence that the organization is aligned, and also gives them a chance to have their input early, when we still had time to adapt our plans. Including one-pagers in your formal planning process is a good way to avoid bike-shedding where big egos want to put their stamp on somethin. Without early planning, this usually surfaces at the end of the project when time and tempers are running short.

## Feature Narrative

Audiences: Potential customers, product development leads

This is an optional step, but I find myself often reaching for this tool as a way of doing validation with customers before fully committing the product development team. The Feature Narrative focuses primarily on the customer workflows, and contains little else. The idea is to, with the most clarity possible, explain how the user solves the problem today (regardless if they use our product), and how you imagine we’d change our product to address that problem. An example might be automating the management of TLS certificates. Everyone has a janky process for this, and would welcome a better solution, but they have a host of restrictions on the manner in which this is implemented. By reviewing with potential customers specifically how their lives would be impacted by this project, I simultaneously got feedback on my idea, heard all about what it would take to make it usable in the real world, and perhaps most importantly, I identified who would be anchor customers and who would be late-followers. Skipping this step would have meant I'd have a harder time later, because I'd need to collect compelling evidence and present it at the same time as deep project planning. Doing this work up front made me look better prepared, especially when I had customer feedback already in the books.

## Product Requirements Document

Audiences: Practically everybody!

Much has been written about [Product Requirements Documents][6]. When I worked with Agile engineering teams, I abhorred PRDs. As I’ve gained more experience I’ve come to appreciate them, and _feel that they are the most effective artifact a product manager can produce_. Regardless of the other steps in the process, if a product manager writes an excellent PRD, everything else becomes a lot easier. That’s because the PRD is the one place where a product manager summarizes and presents nearly all of their daily activities. At a high level, it is the master plan of what the team is actually going to do - hopefully roughly over the next quarter.

    One quarter is generally a good chunk of time - a shorter time frame often doesn’t allow for significant impact (it takes time to build a good installation wizard) and too long doesn’t ship value fast enough to learn and adapt within a given year. I have a personal adage, “You don’t get paid for the projects you start. You get paid for the projects you ship.” If you ship just once or twice a year, it’s really hard to get that value into the hands of customer and give yourself enough time to learn from their experience, adapt your roadmap based on those learnings, and show that you’ve course-corrected in time for your annual review. If you ship more often, it can be hard to make sense of the sheer amount of data coming back, leaving you to depend on trends that are hard to take credit for. Take for example, [cohort analysis][6]. If you track 12 or 24 cohorts over the year, it may take considerable analysis to understand what projects the team executed in that year relate to customer retention. People take time to discover new features and behaviors; you may blow right past them before they have time to catch up. If you track four cohorts a year, it’s still a challenge, but at least you have a few specific events during the year where you can invest in capturing the users’ attention, find ways to draw their activities to the new workflows, spend sufficient time analyzing their behavior such that you can build new learnings into the coming releases, etc. And finally, if you track just one or two cohorts, you’ll be at retirement age before you’ve seen enough data to conclude which of the many activities executed over the course of the year had the most positive impact.

## Epics and User Stories
I know all of this process must seem awfully waterfall. In some ways it is, in that you need time to build a strong case (employing a variety of artifacts) to get the support you need to commit product development to a significant project. It’s also agile, however, in that you (and the team) are doing all the ground to work gather feedback and fail fast. By treating your artifacts as experiments, you are creating the very credibility you need in order to build confidence that the team is doing valuable work.

Ideally, you will follow a very formal review process so that the PRD becomes a universally-approved project plan. That’s the extent of it, though. No project plan has ever gone from document to implementation without a ton of change. Having done a ton of hard work, though, you may find writing epics and stories to be much easier, and better organized, than before. If you documented your workflows, then you already know how to define Requirements (epics) which will win anchor customers. If you’ve detailed those requirements in a PRD, and broken them down into high-level acceptance criteria, then you have the drafts of each of the stories you’ll need to write. Further, you’ll write less because you can point to your PRD for full context.

Once you’ve created those initial drafts of epics and stories, however, the PRD will start to age. And that’s OK! Product life is about constantly incorporating feedback, external and internal. Once your team goes from plan to product, all sorts of issues are going to flow in, requiring you to keep an open, flexible mind. You should review changes in plan with your anchor customers as frequently as possible, understand risk, and work with your team to come up with strategies to stay on track. This is the daily life of a product manager, exploring that tension between customer expectations and what is reasonably practical to implement.

I don’t think it’s reasonable to constantly update the PRD with these new insights and changes. I also don’t think it’s reasonable to go through change control every time you need to zig instead of zag, but different companies feel differently. If you work on silicon, and you’re post tape-out, you may be out of luck. If you work in eCommerce, and it’s holiday shutdown, you may need to wait. But usually, you can adapt your Epics and add stories in such a way that reflect what will actually be implemented, and maintain a record which you and the product development team agree on. Until release notes are published this is the most accurate record of what is being built.

## Conclusion
I hope that this process can be useful to you, and that you find it easy to adapt to your organization’s needs.

One more thing! This process might be the key to scaling your product management team. Doing planning and execution at the same time is a lot of work! That means that even if the product manager partners with peers as much as possible, and works as many hours as possible, the scope of the projects will necessarily be limited. I’ve had very brief periods of time where I’ve been fortunate to be on teams of PMs associated with a single product area. That has allowed us to trade-off, one PM in planning mode, doing research, talking with customers, the other in execution mode, working directly with the team.
