Customer interviews. Competitive analysis. Quantitative roadmapping. Analyst briefings. Vision and strategy documents. Sprint planning. Argh! Time management is the #1 challenge for any product manager.

At the end of the year, when it’s annual review time, how does a PM summarize their efforts in a way that shows that they’re making a significant contribution? In the [Three Types of Validation][1] post, we remind ourselves to focus on those activities for which we are most qualified, maximizing our contribution. In [Three Fundamental Artifacts][2], we talk about the most essential documents any prodouct manager should be producing in order to create and dmonstrate value.

For many roles, measuring contribution is relatively easy (I know this is endlessly debatable). The top-booking people in Sales are likely to get the most recognition. The top-producing engineers (however this is measured), same. The most-widely-published in marketing, the most leads from inside sales… but what about product managers? My answer is artifacts. Not just artifacts, but artifacts that have _measurable impact_.

Why artifacts? Not everything is a document, but the work product of a product manager is, ultimately, conveyed in writing somehow. Documents, sure. But also slide decks, diagrams, roadmaps, and stories. I’ve even produced [wild, Gantt-like things][cf-mysql-gantt] to explain product journeys.

And why impact? I think impact is the most direct reason we hire product managers. We want people who collect evidence and use it to influence our direction. Imagine the chaos if we were ranked by the number of stories written. Prolific story writers don't necessarily result in impact. Focusing on any one PM activity doesn't give the whole picture - PMs who conduct a lot of customer interviews don't necessarily extract hard-won wisdom. PMs who are great visionaries might envision things users don't want. And so on. Finally, PMs tend to focus on product success, but we can’t be measured by sales - how sales is organized and operates is outside of our control.

In many ways, impact is the one duty that is the product manager’s primary responsibility. I don’t like the phrase, “mini-CEO,” because product managers are not CEOs - product engineering doesn’t report to the PM. Neither does marketing, and certainly not the sales team. Product management can't control how those functions carry out their responsibilities, and we can't threaten to fire them. Since we can’t order people what to do, PMs should not be held accountable for their performance - it's outside our control. The role of the PM is to **persuade** people to do what we’ve identified as the most important thing. That's how we should be measured: by how persuasive we've been, and the success that comes from those efforts, however we define success.

A lot of this persuasion is done in person or on video meetings, in order to have an organizational memory, those persuasive arguments must be documented in some way. This is how I define impact: Artifacts created by the product manager which have successfully persuaded the organization to do something that moves the needle.

Sidebar: What about User Adoption?

An argument could be made that a product manager's goal is for the product to be used. By users. So we should track and be evaluated by some user adoption metric.

I believe that user adoption metrics are mandatory because we need them in order to decide to continue an investment, pivot, or divest. I don't believe that user adoption is a good measure for product managers, and could lead to undesirable behavior. For example, if a PM is evaluated based on how they've improved product usage, they'll be disinclined to run experiments. "If I ask the team to do an experiment this year, and it hurts adoption, I might not get a good bonus." Further, every product manager should have some definition of when to kill their own product. There's stigma around this. To run the organization successfully, we want the PMs to be able to say, "This product effort has run its course, and we should wind it down now. It's time to invest our resources somewhere else." It also takes time to wind down a product. During that time, customer usage decreases. Even if the product manager is doing a tremendous job transitioning those users, say, to a 3rd party, they won't be able to demonstrate their contribution if measured by product adoption.

That's why I always come back to impact. Even though it was very scary, I have written artifacts to convince leadership and product teams to change how we invest our resources. Thankfully, I've been in places where there is psychological safety, and my efforts have been appreciated because I was trying to do the right thing for the company.

A successful PM produces many artifacts throughout the course of the year which summarize their learnings which the rest of the organization either accepts or ignores. I’ve met hapless product managers who have created lengthy strategy documents and published roadmaps, but despair, “engineering just does whatever they want, anyways.” Almost always, it’s because the product manager either hasn’t done the fundamental work necessary to build a compelling argument or they haven’t composed that information in a way that people take seriously.

If you can produce on a regular basis, will build to a strong track record of contribution. In my background, it's best to follow a roughly quarterly schedule. This may vary in your environment, so adjust your schedule accordingly. Try to use the shortest cycle possible, to quickly generate a stack of artifacts that describe a trend.

Writing a solid PRD every quarter is a tremendous effort, but packs a spectacular return on investment. It shows evidence that you’ve done your homework. It demonstrates that you’ve been thoughtful about how to apply your learnings. It shows rigor that you’ve taken care not just to define the who and the what, but what specific implementations best guarantee solid adoption. And it gives you and the product team space to define and implement success criteria. All of this combines into a single document for approval at all levels - anyone in any function should be able to review this document, provide feedback, or at least be comfortable in the scope of the effort which may or may not conflict with their personal agenda.

If you show up at review time with four solid PRDs which have been reviewed by your peers and successfully implemented, you will be providing compelling evidence that you’re in the top 10% of product managers.

Keeping epics and stories up to date via whatever processes and ceremonies your organization employs, is paramount to your track record of delivery. A product manager who writes a great PRD, but is disconnected from execution is going to have a much harder time than a product manager who continually practices validation, provides feedback, and generally acts as a bridge and ally between the product development teams, the marketing teams, the sales teams, and most of all, the customers.
