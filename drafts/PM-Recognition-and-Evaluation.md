PM-Recognition-and-Evaluation

Customer interviews. Competitive analysis. Quantitative roadmapping. Analyst briefings. Vision and strategy documents. Sprint planning. Argh! Time management is the #1 challenge for any product manager.

At the end of the year, when it’s annual review, how does a PM summarize their efforts in a way that shows that they’re making a significant contribution? In the [Three Types of Validation][1] post, we remind ourselves to focus on those activities for which we are uniquely qualified, maximizing our contribution. This post will cover what artifacts the product manager can produce which serve as concrete evidence about work done and value added.

For many roles, measuring contribution is relatively easy. The top-booking people in Sales are likely to get the most recognition. The top-producing Engineers (however this is measured), same. The most-widely-read in marketing, the most leads from inside sales… but what about product managers? My answer is artifacts. Not just artifacts, but artifacts that have measurable impact.

Why artifacts? Not everything is a document, but the work product of a Product Manager is, ultimately, conveyed in writing somehow. Documents, sure. But also Slide decks, diagrams, roadmaps, and stories, too. I’ve even produced [wild, Gantt-like things][2] to explain product journeys.

And why impact? Product managers aren’t easily measured by one simple metric. Imagine the chaos if we were ranked by the number of stories written, for example. Most product managers tend to be focused on product success, but we can’t be measured on dollars in sales - how sales is organized and operates is outside of our control.

Enter impact. In many ways, impact is the one duty that is the product manager’s primary responsibility. I don’t like the phrase, “mini-CEO,” because product managers are not CEOs, in that product engineering doesn’t report to the PM. Neither does marketing, and certainly not the sales team. So if we can’t order people what to do, under threat of losing their job otherwise, what leverage do PMs have, and how can they be held accountable? PMs **persuade** people to do what we’ve identified as the most important thing. While a lot of that is done in person or on video meetings, in order to have an organizational memory, those persuasive arguments must be documented in some way. This is how I define impact: Artifacts created by the product manager which have successfully persuaded the organization to do something that moves the needle.

A successful PM produces many artifacts throughout the course of the year which summarize their learnings which the rest of the organization either accepts or ignores. I’ve met hapless product managers who have created lengthy strategy documents and published roadmaps, but despair, “engineering just does whatever they want, anyways.” Almost always, it’s because the product manager either hasn’t done the fundamental work necessary to build a compelling argument or they haven’t composed that information in a way that people take seriously.

Examine this diagram:
![Quarterly Cycle][3]
In my experience, product managers who follow this process can build credibility. Other business functions will be grateful and align to the activities required. I’m sure there are other routes to success, but this process has proven solid.

It starts with the essential basics of product direction and expands from there. It’s very rare for a product manager to drop into a new area without any existing effort. While the documents described in [Your First 100 Days][4] are necessary for the PM to establish her credibility, those are built on these core activities.

**One Pager**
The one-pager (see template) is the most agile way to kick off the process. A one-pager is a proposal to start a project. It covers, at the ideation level, what a new scope of effort might be, based on previously collected evidence. A lot of organizations skip this step, but I feel that it’s a missed opportunity to gather feedback and possibly fail fast. The content of a one-pager describes the core idea (the what), the justification (what opportunity, why us?), and especially why this is a top priority (why now?). This document can be formal or informal. At first, I used this document to review with my product development lead and director. If they were aware of reasons that my plan isn’t wise, “we can design flux-capacitors, but they’re impossible to fabricate,” or, “your idea for a flux-capacitor is already to focus of another part of the organization,” etc, then I’ve lost nothing but a few lines of analysis in a document, and possibly I’ve learned something I should have known. This is much better than coming out with a fully-fleshed out project plan, only to discover it’s not practical, or already solved in some other way.

At other organizations, we made one-pagers a built-in part of the formal planning process. Everywhere, senior management wants to be included in the planning process, but they don’t want to be mired down in details. By assembling the entire set of project proposals, and presenting them in priority order, we can hold a series of meetings each quarter which shows what the teams are proposing to work on, as well as the scope which is being delayed. This gives senior management confidence that the product organization is aligned and functioning smoothly, and also gives them a chance to have their input early on, when we still have time to adapt our plans. Including one-pagers in your formal planning process is critical to avoid bike-shedding where fragile egos want to put their stamp on something, usually at the end of the project when time, and tempers, are running short.

**Feature Narrative**
This is an optional step, but I find myself often reaching for this tool as a way of doing validation with customers before fully committing the product development team. The Feature Narrative focuses primarily on the customer workflows, and contains little else. The idea is to, with the most clarity possible, explain how the user solves the problem today (regardless if they use our product), and how I imagine we’d change our product to address the problem. An example might be automating the management of TLS certificates. Everyone has a janky process for this, and would welcome a better solution, but they have a host of restrictions on the manner in which this is implemented. By reviewing with potential customers specifically how their lives would be impacted by this project, I simultaneously get feedback on my idea, I hear all about what it would take to make it usable in the real world, and perhaps most importantly, I can identify who would be anchor customers and who would be late-followers. Skipping this step means I have a harder time later, because I need to collect compelling evidence and present it at the same time as deep project planning.

**Product Requirements Document**
Much has been written about product requirements documents (see template). When I worked with Agile engineering teams, I abhorred PRDs. As I’ve gained more experience I’ve come to appreciate them, and feel that they are the most effective artifact a product manager can produce which demonstrates compelling impact. Regardless of all other steps in the process, if a product manager writes an excellent PRD, everything else can fall into place. That’s because the PRD is the one place where a product manager summarizes and presents nearly all of their daily activities. While you may have iterated on bits and pieces, the PRD is the place where it all comes together, because it is the master plan document of what the team is actually going to do - hopefully roughly over the next quarter.

One quarter is generally a good chunk of time - a shorter time frame often doesn’t allow for significant impact (it takes time to build a good installation wizard) and too long doesn’t ship value fast enough to learn and adapt within a given year. I have a personal adage, “You don’t get paid for the projects you start. You get paid for the projects you ship.” If you ship just once or twice a year, it’s really hard to get that value into the hands of customer and give yourself enough time to learn from their experience, adapt your roadmap based on those learnings, and show that you’ve course-corrected in time for your annual review. If you ship more often, it can be hard to make sense of the sheer amount of data coming back, leaving you to depend on trends that are hard to take credit for. Take for example, [cohort analysis][5]. If you track 12 or 24 cohorts over the year, it may take considerable analysis to understand what projects the team executed in that year relate to customer retention. People take time to discover new features and behaviors; you may blow right past them before they have time to catch up. If you track four cohorts a year, it’s still a challenge, but at least you have a few specific events during the year where you can invest in capturing the users’ attention, find ways to draw their activities to the new workflows, spend sufficient time analyzing their behavior such that you can build new learnings into the coming releases, etc. And finally, if you track just one or two cohorts, you’ll be at retirement age before you’ve seen enough data to conclude which of the many activities executed over the course of the year had the most positive impact.

Writing a solid PRD every quarter is a tremendous effort, but packs a spectacular return on investment. It shows evidence that you’ve done your homework. It demonstrates that you’ve been thoughtful about how to apply your learnings. It shows rigor that you’ve taken care not just to define the who and the what, but what specific implementations best guarantee solid adoption. And it gives you and the product team space to define and implement success criteria. All of this combines into a single document for approval at all levels - anyone in any function should be able to review this document, provide feedback, or at least be comfortable in the scope of the effort which may or may not conflict with their personal agenda.

If you show up at review time with four solid PRDs which have been reviewed by your peers and successfully implemented, you will be providing compelling evidence that you’re in the top 10% of product managers.

**Epics and User Stories**
I know all of this process must seem awfully waterfall. In one respect, it is, in that you need time to build a strong case (employing a variety of artifacts) to get the support you need to commit product development to a significant project. It’s also agile, however, in that you (and the team) are doing all the ground to work gather feedback and fail fast. By treating your artifacts as experiments, you are creating the very credibility you need in order to build confidence that the team is doing valuable work.

Ideally, you will follow a very formal review process so that the PRD becomes a universally-approved project plan. That’s the extent of it, though. No project plan has ever gone from document to implementation without a ton of change. Having done a ton of hard work, though, you may find writing epics and stories to be much easier, and better organized, than before. If you documented your workflows, then you already know how to define Requirements (epics) which will win anchor customers. If you’ve detailed those requirements in a PRD, and broken them down into high-level acceptance criteria, then you have the drafts of each of the stories you’ll need to write. Further, you’ll write less because you can point to your PRD for full context.

Once you’ve created those initial drafts of epics and stories, however, the PRD will start to age. And that’s OK! Product life is about constantly incorporating feedback, external and internal. Once your team goes from plan to product, all sorts of issues are going to flow in, requiring you to keep an open, flexible mind. You should review changes in plan with your anchor customers as frequently as possible, understand risk, and work with your team to come up with strategies to stay on track. This is the daily life of a product manager, exploring that tension between customer expectations and what is reasonably practical to implement.

I don’t think it’s reasonable to constantly update the PRD with these new insights and changes. I also don’t think it’s reasonable to go through change control every time you need to zig instead of zag, but different companies feel differently. If you work on silicon, and you’re post tape-out, you may be out of luck. If you work in eCommerce, and it’s holiday shutdown, you may need to wait. But usually, you can adapt your Epics and add stories in such a way that reflect what will actually be implemented, and maintain a record which you and the product development team agree on. Until release notes are published this is the most accurate record of what is being built.

Keeping epics and stories up to date via whatever processes and ceremonies your organization employs, is paramount to your track record of delivery. A product manager who writes a great PRD, but is disconnected from execution is going to have a much harder time than a product manager who continually practices validation, provides feedback, and generally acts as a bridge and ally between the product development teams, the marketing teams, the sales teams, and most of all, the customers.

## Conclusion
I hope that this process can be useful to you, and that you find it easy to adapt to your organization’s needs.

Also! This process might be the key to scaling your product management team. Doing planning and execution at the same time is a lot of work! That means that even if the product manager partners with peers as much as possible, and works as many hours as possible, the scope of the projects will necessarily be limited. I’ve had very brief periods of time where I’ve been fortunate to be on teams of PMs associated with a single product area. That has allowed us to trade-off, one PM in planning mode, doing research, talking with customers, the other in execution mode, working directly with the team.
