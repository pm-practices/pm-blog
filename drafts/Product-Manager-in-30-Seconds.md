Product-Manager-in-30-Seconds

I often ask people how, in 30 seconds, would they describe what a product manager does, in a way that can be understood by both technical and non-technical people. I get a wide variety of answers, it’s super fascinating.

One of the motivators of this blog is to acknowledge that there are many ways to manage product; and some are more effective than others. While I don’t judge other successful PMs, I do have experience with an approach to product management which I know yields results.

Here’s my thirty second view of what a product manager does. What do you think? Does this ring true for you, does it miss major points, or I have got something fundamentally wrong?

	The product manager is a member of the team who has specific job responsibilities. Their goal is not to write code. The PM’s primary activity is to collect evidence which determines if the product development team is working on the most important thing at any given moment. That's a full time job, because that evidence comes from talking with a wide variety of people, existing and potential customers, as well as stakeholders within their organization. The product manager shares the insights they've learned with the team, so that collectively, they can make informed decisions about the future of the product.

Note: I acknowledge that this definition only works when there is a reasonable ratio of product manager to engineers. If there are too many engineers, then there are too many initiatives for a PM to track, and they’ll fall behind. In those cases, it’s necessary for the PM to level up their work. Unfortunately, most of my experiences doing that have resulted in poor results.

Thus, whenever I have the chance, I use this definition to justify why we should have a better engineer to product manager ratio. There are a lot of organizational implications which stem from this. That will be a topic of separate blog post.
