# Three Types of Validation
Behold this lovely diagram, which I have been drawing on white boards for years.

This encapsulates three different kinds of validation which Product Managers are primarily responsible for. Let's break these down.
1. Daily validation: is what we're building the right thing to build? Are we confident that when we ship, that the intended customers will be happy? In many ways, this is the most essential form of validation, because engineers need feedback as quickly as possible, before the context fades. If you look at something the day of, "oh gosh, this will never work for Home Warehouse and others like them, that type of customer would definitely prefer it this way," then you may get some grumbling, but it can be done. However! If you wait to do this style of validation till after the release has shipped, you're going to get a whole different kind of response from the engineering team.
2. Roadmap planning: Building off a release, it's the Product Manager's primary job to look ahead, "what should we do next?" This is the core responsibility, and the primary function, of a Product Manager, to own the roadmap. So we take what we've shipped recently, or are planning to ship soon, review that with customers, and say, "once we've done this, what will we need to do in order for you to give us money?" A lot of times this activity is disguised as "requirements," and I have a little rant about requirements below.
3. Success measurement: This is equally important, if not more so, than the other two. However, it's very rare that product managers make time to do this, or if they do, it's often via quantitative measurements which may or may not be helpful. And yet, without this validation, how do you know if you've really hit the mark? It's one thing to say, "we've shipped the networking wizard," it's quite another to say, "we know that the networking wizard is working, we've gotten both qualitative feedback that Home Warehouse is thrilled with it, as well as quantitative data that more people are succeeding in the desired task when they use the wizard, as compared to users who did not."

**All three** of these activities is essential for the product manager to know if the product offered is likely to succeed, and what's most important for the product development team to do next. Doing this work is a full time job! It takes a tremendous amount of time to make the connections, arrange meetings, share, and record feedback from the people we are targeting.

When people in different functions (sales, marketing, engineering) ask PMs to do a wide variety of tasks, "fill out this compliance survey," "write this blog article," "have dinner with a potential customer," those activities take time from the core responsibilities of a product manager. Many times in my life, I've used this diagram to point out how
