# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to fostering an inclusive and respectful environment, ensuring that our content remains valuable, professional, and free from abuse or discrimination.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
* **Professionalism:** All contributions should maintain a high level of professionalism. This includes the accuracy of information, clarity of expression, and adherence to ethical standards. Content should be well-researched, properly cited (if applicable), and reflect a thoughtful perspective on the subject matter.
* **Respect and Inclusivity:** We value diverse perspectives and experiences. All interactions and content must be respectful and inclusive, ideally promoting a positive and welcoming atmosphere for all readers and contributors. Discriminatory language, hate speech, or any form of harassment based on age, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other characteristic will not be tolerated.
* **Constructive Engagement:** We encourage healthy debate and the sharing of differing viewpoints, but all discussions must remain constructive and polite. Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory remarks are unacceptable. Focus on the ideas and content, not the individual.
* **Accuracy and Integrity:** Contributors are responsible for the accuracy of their submissions. Plagiarism, misrepresentation of facts, or intentional dissemination of false information is strictly prohibited.
* **No Abuse or Harassment:** Any form of abuse, harassment, bullying, or intimidation directed at other contributors, readers, or any individual or group will result in immediate removal of content and potential exclusion from future contributions. This includes, but is not limited to, offensive comments, threats, doxing, or any behavior that creates a hostile environment.
* **Privacy:** Respect the privacy of others. Do not share personal information about individuals without their express consent.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you witness or experience any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it immediately to [team@pm-practices.org](mailto:team@pm-practices.org). All reports will be handled with discretion and promptly investigated. _All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident._

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in the following actions, including but not limited to:
* Removal of the offending content.
* Temporary or permanent suspension from contributing to the blog series.
* Reporting to relevant authorities if illegal activities are involved.

By contributing to our blog series, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct. We believe that by upholding these standards, we can create a valuable and respectful platform for professional discourse.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Temporary Ban
**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 3. Permanent Ban
**Consequence**: Consequences for a pattern of sustained inappropriate behavior. A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
